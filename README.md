# NewsApp-stage1

The news app gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location from Guardian. 
It was written in Java and Android.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills, using Guardian API. They include:
•	Connecting to an API
•	Parsing the JSON response
•	Handling error cases
•	Updating information regularly
•	Networking operations are done using a Loader rather than an AsyncTask
•	Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle

App queries the content.guardianapis.com api to fetch news stories related to a particular topic. Clicking on a story uses an intent to open the story in the user’s browser.

This is just a practice app for the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships">Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics</a> I received for the Android Basics path.
